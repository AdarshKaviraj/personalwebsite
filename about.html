        <h1>About</h1>
        
        <p>I'm Adarsh Kaviraj, founder of LatSpace, where we're building AI systems that address climate change and environmental challenges. My journey spans the intersection of technology, sustainability, and human-centered design.</p>

        <p>As a startup founder, I've learned that the most impactful innovations emerge when we combine technical sophistication with deep empathy for human needs and planetary boundaries. My work focuses on creating technology that doesn't just solve problems, but does so in ways that enhance rather than exploit our world.</p>

        <h2>LatSpace: AI x Sustainability</h2>
        
        <p>At LatSpace, we're pioneering AI applications that make sustainability actionable and scalable. Our mission is to demonstrate that environmental responsibility and technological innovation aren't just compatible—they're necessarily intertwined. We're building the intelligent systems that will help humanity navigate the climate transition.</p>

        <h2>What I Write About</h2>
        
        <p>My writing explores the edges where different domains meet:</p>
        
        <p><strong>AI & Sustainability:</strong> How artificial intelligence can accelerate our response to environmental challenges while remaining conscious of its own footprint.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Startup Philosophy:</strong> The mental models, frameworks, and principles that guide building companies with both impact and integrity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Design & Technology:</strong> Creating interfaces and experiences that respect human attention and promote thoughtful interaction.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Abstract Concepts:</strong> Exploring the deeper patterns that connect technology, consciousness, and our collective future.</p>

        <p><strong>Work & Culture:</strong> Building organizations that balance high performance with human flourishing.</p>

        <p><strong>Branding & Identity:</strong> How startups can create authentic brands that resonate without manipulation.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        
        <p>Before founding LatSpace, I immersed myself in understanding both the technical and philosophical aspects of AI development. This dual perspective—engineer and philosopher, builder and thinker—shapes everything I create.</p>

        <p>I believe that the founders of our generation have a unique responsibility: to build technology that heals rather than harms, that connects rather than divides, that sustains rather than depletes. This isn't idealism—it's pragmatism for the long term.</p>

        <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
        
        <p>I'm always interested in connecting with fellow founders, thinkers, and builders working at the intersection of technology and impact. Whether you're working on sustainability, exploring AI applications, or simply thinking deeply about the future we're creating, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
